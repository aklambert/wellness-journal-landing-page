       Once the BEGIN button has been clicked, the Welcome screen will no longer display upon opening the app. Instead, the app will open directly into the Home screen.

    :::warning Note

       In this version of the app, there is not a navigation bar at the top of the screen after the first transition from the Welcome screen to the Home screen. The Android back button still works. Closing and reopening the app will allow that action bar to show up, where it will stay unless the app is uninstalled and reinstalled on the device again.
