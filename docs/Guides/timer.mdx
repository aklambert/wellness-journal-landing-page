# Timer

There is a timer function available to use on the **Timer** screen. This is a basic countdown 
timer that may be useful for workouts, setting focus timers, setting timers to switch between 
standing and sitting, etc.  

To use the timer, follow these steps: 
 
1. Go to the **Timer** bottom navigation option

    <img src={timerNavigation} style={{width: 240}} />

2. The page will display input options for number of hours, minutes, and seconds 
3. Enter the desired amount of time for the timer and click the **START TIMER** button.
    Make sure the media volume on the phone and the computer (if running an emulator) are both turned up 
    so you can hear when the timer goes off

    <img src={startTimer} style={{width: 240}} />
 
4. Once the timer is running, there is a display showing how much time is left, and a **STOP TIMER** button will appear as well 
5. To cancel the timer, click the **STOP TIMER** button. 
    The timer will then stop, and you will be able to start a new timer

        <img src={stopTimer} style={{width: 240}} />
    
6. When a set timer finishes, an alarm will sound and the screen will display a message saying the timer is finished

    <img src={timerFinished} style={{width: 200}} />
 
    :::info Note

        - The alarm does not repeat so that it is not too disruptive, for cases when the timer is used as a focus timer,
        or a timer for reminding users to switch between sitting and standing while working
        - The timer will keep running as long as the timer page is open. If you leave the page, or close the app, the timer will cancel. 
            Leaving the timer page open while leaving the app will not cancel the timer
